README

This is an updated version of a pre-existing channel creator used for Publica channel management. This updated file has capabilities to create SCN endpoints in addition to TV+, Mobile, and Family Hub integrations.

The program takes as input a list of channels, organized through a Google sheet, and outputs endpoints into a CSV document. This pathway has to be changed depending on the user.

I am also working on capabilities to have channels be automatically added to groups.
